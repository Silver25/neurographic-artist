## Purpose

The objective of this project is to create a responsive website utilizing Python/Django, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (Bootstrap), 
representing a full stack development approach.  

At present, the project serves solely educational purposes and bears no connection to any existing real-life counterparts. 
The content of the website is tailored for individuals seeking tranquility and relaxation. 
Users will have the ability to explore the website through an operational navigation bar that directs them to various sections of the site.  

Furthermore, the website provides an engaging experience of contemporary web dynamics by facilitating visitor interaction with forms and content modification.

- installation of needed extensions for VS Code
- saving global credentials for Git [for connection from VS Code to GitHub]
- test of installed components
- Organize a *folder structure* - main folder for all Projects ...
- .. and with copy of the repository/clone, subfolder for each project creates VS Code
- clone of remote/GitHub repository download last version of the code, files and attachments
- for fully functional project to run locally on a computer it's important to install all dependencies
- with command in terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt VS Code will install everything from the list
